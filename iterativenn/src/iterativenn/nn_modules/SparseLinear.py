class SparseLinear(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    This implements a module with two sparse matrices. One is trainable
    and one is not.  This leads to a very general setup where each entry
    can be either:

    0 and not trainable
    arbitrary and not trainable
    arbitrary and trainable

    Only the later two cost computation, while the first is "free".

    The weight is defined as

    :math:`A = S_T*S_M + S_N`

    Where S_T is sparse and trainable, and S_N is sparse and not
    trainable.

    Once that is done this is identical to a linear layer, and it applies a 
    linear transformation to the incoming data: 

    :math:`y = xA^T + b`

    Args:
        in_features: size of each input sample
        out_features: size of each output sample
        bias: If set to ``False``, the layer will not learn an additive bias.
            Default: ``True``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*, H_{in})` where :math:`*` means any number of
        dimensions including none and :math:`H_{in} = \text{in\_features}`.
        - Output: :math:`(*, H_{out})` where all but the last dimension
        are the same shape as the input and :math:`H_{out} = \text{out\_features}`.

    Attributes:
        weight: the learnable weights of the module of shape
            :math:`(\text{out\_features}, \text{in\_features})`. The values are
            initialized from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})`, where
            :math:`k = \frac{1}{\text{in\_features}}`
        bias:   the learnable bias of the module of shape :math:`(\text{out\_features})`.
                If :attr:`bias` is ``True``, the values are initialized from
                :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
                :math:`k = \frac{1}{\text{in\_features}}`
    Examples::
            >>> mask = torch.ones(20, 30)        
            >>> m = MaskedLinear(20, 30, mask)
            >>> s = SparseLinear.from_MaskedLinearExact(m)
            >>> input = torch.randn(128, 20)
            >>> output = s(input)
